## Training History of Tools: FACS

```{r FACS, echo = FALSE}
# This looks at the trend of training tool score
# by customer for FACS
FACS_ID <- FACS %>%
  group_by(user_id) %>%
  unique()

FACS_ID %>%
  group_by(user_id, date_taken, score) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date_taken,
             y = score,
             color = user_id)) +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  xlab("Date") +
  ylab("Score")

FACS_ID %>%
  kable()

```

```{r FACS-number-of-times-taken, echo = FALSE}
# This looks at the number of times FACS is taken
# on average by customers
FACS_ID %>%
  group_by(user_id) %>%
  tally() %>%
  summarize(mean_count = mean(n)) %>%
  print()
  
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
